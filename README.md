## 📌 How It Works

### 1️⃣ Navigation & Sections

- Smooth scroll and animations make transitions seamless.

### 2️⃣ Testimonials Slider
- The slider automatically cycles through reviews.
- Uses `setInterval()` to change slides every **3 seconds**.
- Resets smoothly to the first slide after the last.

### 3️⃣ Booking Modal
- Clicking the **"Book Now"** button opens a modal.
- Users enter their **name and phone number** for a callback request.
- Simple form validation included.

### 4️⃣ Reveal on Scroll
- Sections smoothly appear as you scroll down.
- Implemented via a custom React hook (`useRevealOnScroll`).
